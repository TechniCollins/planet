# Planet Restaurant

Computer systems shouldn't get in the way of doing work. They should streamline processes and be as easy to use as possible. This is not the case, however, with most restaurant management systems in the market. Current solutions pack too many features that are often not needed by small businesses. Most times, small businesses only need two things;

1. To keep track of sales records in order to avoid daunting (and probably inaccurate) paperwork.
2. Simple analytics to keep track of revenue and easily identify points of improvement.

Planet restaurant management system is an open source minimalist system for managing small, single restaurants. It is a minimalist system that provides only essential features, making it easy to manage orders in 3 to 4 screens. It also has simple to understand, yet powerful analytics dashboard that help businesses identify areas of improvement.
